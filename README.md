# ARP-Poisoning
MITM attack using ARP Poisoning

This repository showcases a hands-on project where I performed an **ARP poisoning (Man-in-the-Middle)** attack using **Bettercap** on Kali Linux. The objective was to intercept unencrypted HTTP traffic between a victim and the gateway, mimicking real-world attack scenarios in a controlled environment.

I scanned the network, poisoned ARP tables, sniffed packets in real-time, and analyzed the intercepted data using **Wireshark**. The process and findings have been documented in a detailed report, with screenshots and `.pcap` data included for reference and learning.
